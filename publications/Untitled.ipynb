The high temporal revisit of current and forthcoming missions and the scarcity of labeled data force us to cast cloud screening as an unsupervised change detection problem in the temporal domain. We introduce a cloud screening method based on detecting abrupt changes along the time dimension. The main assumption is that image time series follow smooth variations over land (background) and abrupt changes will be mainly due to the presence of clouds. The method estimates the background surface changes using the information in the time series. In particular, we propose linear and nonlinear least squares regression algorithms that minimize both the prediction and the estimation error simultaneously. Then, significant differences in the image of interest with respect to the estimated background are identified as clouds. The use of kernel methods allows the generalization of the algorithm to account for higher-order (nonlinear) feature relations. After the proposed cloud masking and cloud removal, cloud-free time series at high spatial resolution can be used to obtain a better monitoring of land cover dynamics and to generate more elaborated products. The method is tested in a dataset with 5-day revisit time series from SPOT-4 at high resolution and with Landsat-8 time series. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields more accurate cloud masks when confronted with state-of-the-art approaches typically used in operational settings. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform, which allows us to access the full Landsat-8 catalog and work in a parallel distributed platform to extend its applicability to a global planetary scale.',\n",

Cloud detection is particularly challenging for Proba-V due to the presence of a limited number of spectral bands and the lack of thermal infrared bands. The main objective of the project was the inter-comparison of several cloud detection algorithms for Proba-V over a wide range of surface types and environmental conditions. Proba-V Level 2a products have been distributed to six different algorithm providers representing companies and research institutes in several European countries. The considered cloud detection approaches are based on different strategies: Neural Network, Discriminant Analysis, Multi-spectral and Multi-textural Thresholding, Self-Organizing Feature Maps, Dynamic Thresholding, and physically-based retrieval of Cloud Optical Thickness. The results from all algorithms were analysed and compared against a reference dataset, consisting of a large number (more than fifty thousands) of visually classified pixels.\\nThe quality assessment was performed according to a uniform methodology and the results provide clear indication on the potential best-suited approach for next Proba-V cloud detection algorithm.',\n",

However, they are computationally expensive to train when a large amount of samples are used.\\nIn this context, while the amount of available remote sensing data has constantly increased, the size of training sets in kernel methods is usually restricted to few thousand samples.\\nIn this work, we modified the Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) training procedure to deal with large scale datasets. In addition, the basis functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space are defined as parameters to be also optimized during the training process. This extends the number of free parameters from two (in the standard KRR with an RBF kernel) to more than fifty thousand in our experiments. The effectiveness of the proposal is illustrated in the problem of surface temperature estimation from MetOp-IASI hyperspectral infrared sounding data. The data set used contains more than one million samples, but the proposed method could potentially be trained with much more data.',\n",

       " 'perez-suay_fair_2017': {'abstract': 'New social and economic activities massively exploit big data and machine learning algorithms to do inference on people’s lives. Applications include automatic curricula evaluation, wage determination, and risk assessment for credits and loans. Recently, many governments and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of fairness, equity and ethics in machine learning to treat these problems. It has been shown that not including sensitive features that bias fairness, such as gender or race, is not enough to mitigate the discrimination when other related features are included. Instead, including fairness in the objective function has been shown to be more efficient.We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive descriptors.',\n",

CDOM is optically characterized by its spectral absorption coefficient,    a  C D O M     at at reference wavelength (e.g., \\\\&asymp; 440 nm). Retrieval of CDOM is traditionally done using bio-optical models. As an alternative, this paper presents a comparison of five machine learning methods applied to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 simulated reflectance (    R  r s     ) data for the retrieval of CDOM: regularized linear regression (RLR), random forest regression (RFR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machines (SVR). Two different datasets of radiative transfer simulations are used for the development and training of the machine learning regression approaches. Statistics comparison with well-established polynomial regression algorithms shows optimistic results for all models and band combinations, highlighting the good performance of the methods, especially the GPR approach, when all bands are used as input. Application to an atmospheric corrected OLCI image using the reflectance derived form the alternative neural network (Case 2 Regional) is also shown. Python scripts and notebooks are provided to interested users.',\n",
