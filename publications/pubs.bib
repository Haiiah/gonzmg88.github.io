	abstract = {Automatic cloud masking of Earth observation images is one of the first required steps in optical remote sensing data processing since the operational use and product generation from satellite image time series might be hampered by undetected clouds. The high temporal revisit of current and forthcoming missions and the scarcity of labeled data force us to cast cloud screening as an unsupervised change detection problem in the temporal domain. We introduce a cloud screening method based on detecting abrupt changes along the time dimension. The main assumption is that image time series follow smooth variations over land (background) and abrupt changes will be mainly due to the presence of clouds. The method estimates the background surface changes using the information in the time series. In particular, we propose linear and nonlinear least squares regression algorithms that minimize both the prediction and the estimation error simultaneously. Then, significant differences in the image of interest with respect to the estimated background are identified as clouds. The use of kernel methods allows the generalization of the algorithm to account for higher-order (nonlinear) feature relations. After the proposed cloud masking and cloud removal, cloud-free time series at high spatial resolution can be used to obtain a better monitoring of land cover dynamics and to generate more elaborated products. The method is tested in a dataset with 5-day revisit time series from SPOT-4 at high resolution and with Landsat-8 time series. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields more accurate cloud masks when confronted with state-of-the-art approaches typically used in operational settings. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform, which allows us to access the full Landsat-8 catalog and work in a parallel distributed platform to extend its applicability to a global planetary scale.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses results from 12 months of a Round Robin exercise aimed at the inter-comparison of different cloud detection algorithms for Proba-V. 
Clouds detection is a critical issue for satellite optical remote sensing, since potential errors in cloud masking directly translates into significant uncertainty in the retrieved downstream geophysical products. Cloud detection is particularly challenging for Proba-V due to the presence of a limited number of spectral bands and the lack of thermal infrared bands. The main objective of the project was the inter-comparison of several cloud detection algorithms for Proba-V over a wide range of surface types and environmental conditions. Proba-V Level 2a products have been distributed to six different algorithm providers representing companies and research institutes in several European countries. The considered cloud detection approaches are based on different strategies: Neural Network, Discriminant Analysis, Multi-spectral and Multi-textural Thresholding, Self-Organizing Feature Maps, Dynamic Thresholding, and physically-based retrieval of Cloud Optical Thickness. The results from all algorithms were analysed and compared against a reference dataset, consisting of a large number (more than fifty thousands) of visually classified pixels. 
The quality assessment was performed according to a uniform methodology and the results provide clear indication on the potential best-suited approach for next Proba-V cloud detection algorithm.},

	abstract = {New social and economic activities massively exploit big data and machine learning algorithms to do inference on people’s lives. Applications include automatic curricula evaluation, wage determination, and risk assessment for credits and loans. Recently, many governments and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of fairness, equity and ethics in machine learning to treat these problems. It has been shown that not including sensitive features that bias fairness, such as gender or race, is not enough to mitigate the discrimination when other related features are included. Instead, including fairness in the objective function has been shown to be more efficient.We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive descriptors.},

Two different datasets of radiative transfer simulations are used for the development and training of the machine learning regression approaches. Statistics comparison with well-established polynomial regression algorithms shows optimistic results for all models and band combinations, highlighting the good performance of the methods, especially the GPR approach, when all bands are used as input.

The proposed methodology is tested for the Landsat-8 mission over a large collection of manually labeled cloud masks from the Biome dataset.

4. We went through some of the most famous books in stochastic calculus, Brownian motion and martingale theory highlighting several passages of those books that contains the proofs of the theorems or a further development of the exposed ideas.

In this work, we modified the kernel ridge regression (KRR) training procedure to deal with large scale datasets. In addition, the basis functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space are defined as parameters to be also optimized during the training process. This extends the number of free parameters from two (in the standard KRR with an RBF kernel) to more than fifty thousand in our experiments. The effectiveness of the proposal is illustrated in the problem of surface temperature estimation from MetOp-IASI hyperspectral infrared sounding data. The data set used contains more than one million samples, but the proposed method could potentially be trained with much more data.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in the last decades for agricultural applications, both for assessing vegetation condition and for subsequent yield prediction. Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d−1 m−2, which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r2 of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d−1 m−2), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.},

Despite the capabilities of modern satellites, there is still much to be desired from the perspective of first response organisations like UNICEF. Two main challenges are rapid access to data, and the ability to automatically identify flooded regions in images. We describe a prototypical flood segmentation system, identifying cloud, water and land, that could be deployed on a constellation of small satellites, performing processing on board to reduce downlink bandwidth by 2 orders of magnitude. We target PhiSat-1, part of the FSSCAT mission, which is planned to be launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) near the start of 2020 as a proof of concept for this new technology.},

	abstract = {Earth observation from satellites poses challenging problems where machine learning is being widely adopted as a key player. Perhaps the most challenging scenario that we are facing nowadays is to provide accurate estimates of particular variables of interest characterizing the Earth's surface. This chapter introduces some recent advances in statistical bio-geophysical parameter retrieval from satellite data. In particular, we will focus on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that has excelled in parameter estimation as well as in modeling complex radiative transfer processes. GPR is based on solid Bayesian statistics and generally yields efficient and accurate parameter estimates, accompanied by confidence intervals for the estimations. We will first review the standard application of GPs for parameter retrieval and inverse modeling, which is based on regressing the parameter of interest on the concurrent observations. Secondly, noting that very often several parameters need to be estimated simultaneously, we review the field of multioutput GPR and illustrate its application in gap filling of multiple time series of parameters. The third GP modeling that we review here is that of combining real and simulated data. Very often a forward model encoding the well-understood physical relations is available. Inverting the model with GP is a standard practice known as hybrid modeling. In addition, we review a joint GP (JGP) model that combines both in situ measurements and simulated data in a single GP model and allows us to transfer information across spatial, temporal, and land cover modalities such as different crops. In recent years, forced by the data deluge, a plethora of large-scale GP models were introduced. We review recent advances and illustrate their performance for the estimation of surface temperature from infrared sounding data. Finally, we take a reversed pathway and focus on mimicking physical models with GPs. We present an automatic emulation scheme that approximates the forward physical model via interpolation, reducing the number of necessary nodes. Empirical evidence of the performance of these models will be presented through illustrative examples of land and vegetation monitoring.},

	abstract = {Training machine learning algorithms for new satellites requires collecting new data. This is a critical drawback for most remote sensing applications and specially for cloud detection. A sensible strategy to mitigate this problem is to exploit available data from a similar sensor, which involves transforming this data to resemble the new sensor data. However, even taking into account the technical characteristics of both sensors to transform the images, statistical differences between data distributions still remain. This results in a poor performance of the methods trained on one sensor and applied to the new one. In this this work, we propose to use the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework to adapt the data from the new satellite. In particular, we use Landsat-8 images, with the corresponding ground truth, to perform cloud detection in Proba-V. Results show that the GANs adaptation significantly improves the detection accuracy.},

	abstract = {Accurate cloud detection algorithms are mandatory to analyze the large streams of data coming from the different optical Earth observation satellites. Deep learning (DL) based cloud detection schemes provide very accurate cloud detection models. However, training these models for a given sensor requires large datasets of manually labeled samples, which are very costly or even impossible to create when the satellite has not been launched yet. In this work, we present an approach that exploits manually labeled datasets from one satellite to train deep learning models for cloud detection that can be applied (or transferred) to other satellites. We take into account the physical properties of the acquired signals and propose a simple transfer learning approach using Landsat-8 and Proba-V sensors, whose images have different but similar spatial and spectral characteristics. Three types of experiments are conducted to demonstrate that transfer learning can work in both directions: (a) from Landsat-8 to Proba-V, where we show that models trained only with Landsat-8 data produce cloud masks 5 points more accurate than the current operational Proba-V cloud masking method, (b) from Proba-V to Landsat-8, where models that use only Proba-V data for training have an accuracy similar to the operational FMask in the publicly available Biome dataset (87.79–89.77\% vs 88.48\%), and (c) jointly from Proba-V and Landsat-8 to Proba-V, where we demonstrate that using jointly both data sources the accuracy increases 1–10 points when few Proba-V labeled images are available. These results highlight that, taking advantage of existing publicly available cloud masking labeled datasets, we can create accurate deep learning based cloud detection models for new satellites, but without the burden of collecting and labeling a large dataset of images.},
