    "# Why Radial Basis Function Neural Networks are equivalent to Nystrom method\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN) and Nystrom methods are two methods that can be used for regression. They come from different *statistical learning* frameworks: RBFN were proposed in the context of *shallow* neural networks: this is a three layer neural network where the hidden layer computes the rbf similarities to a set of *centroids*. Then a fully connected layer is added to give the final prediction. Nystrom method was proposed in the kernel machine literature as a way to reduce the computational burden of the full kernel similarity matrix $K$. Nystrom was proposed latter, however it can be applied to different kernel approaches, not only regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalence of the method is not something unkown that we came up to; however we feel it is not cristal clear the relationship as perhaps seems for experts in the field. In (Quiñonero-Candela 2005) and in Rassmussen book this relations are taken from granted. In addition another clear proof of the people awareness of this relationship is the [scikit learn implementation of Nystrom method](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/plot_kernel_approximation.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-kernel-approximation-py), which explicitly uses this relationship. In this way the purpose of this post is to shed light in the *proof* of this relationship which helps to better understand this poweful methods. First we show the relation into an *empirical risk minimization* setting, later we will do the *bayesian* approach which leads to the so called **sparse $\\mathcal{GP}$** methods, the `RBFN` network is called in this context the **Subset of Regressors (SoR)** method. **Sparse $\\mathcal{GP}$s** is an active field of research which have had many contributions over the last years."
